<h2>Brainwave Optimization™</h2>

<p>Life’s solutions begin with brain solutions. Most of life’s struggles are eased when the brain is in a state of balance and harmony. Brainwave Optimization™ is a proven effective path to regaining focus, control, peace, hope and health.
Nearly none of us escapes life without some form of trauma. Whether it’s war, a birth trauma, the death of a loved one, a car accident, a physical injury or a broken heart, we all experience some form of traumatic events. The result can be nervousness, anger, mind racing, sleep problems, digestive problems, and sometimes fear. The invisible wound is how trauma has seriously altered your brain.  Once your brain is balanced, your opportunities are endless.
You can easily become part of the balanced brain movement. It begins with a brain assessment, an assessment that will finally give you a good look at what’s going on inside your own brain. Consider it your best blueprint for success. Call us to schedule your sessions today!

										<p>Brainwave Optimization™ is about optimizing the brain, and hence optimizing all of the 
										functions of the brain. When our brain is in balance, we find ourselves thinking clearly. Not only does a balanced brain generate thoughts, ideas,
										imagination and feelings that are tailored to our unique individuality, our brain is now able to have a major impact on what we absorb and how effectively we
										use what we learn. Hence, it empowers us to accomplish goals we previously thought impossible. Entertainers, artists, executives, elders, meditators, students 
										and athletes all find that Brainwave Optimization can lead to achieving new levels of personal goals.</p>

										 <p>Brainwave Optimization™ is for individuals who wish to make a life change from the inside-out.  It is for those who believe that they have the inner resources that, if accessed, can provide them with a path that meets their own unique needs.  Numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of meditation on our health.  In the fast paced world we live in today, it is crucial for our well-being to make time for some balance and harmony in our brains and in our lives.</p>

										 <h3>Executive Decision Making</h3>
										 <p>Operating in the competitive world of business means that our brain must be firing on all cylinders. When we speak of balancing the brain, we are talking about allowing both the heart and logic needed to execute a task be present in appropriate amounts, given the particular situation. In a balanced brain, feeling and thought match each other, so that the end product of a person’s actions is tailored to both a logical solution and one everyone can feel good about.</p>

										 <p>From painters to sculptors, from poets to novelists, people who have experienced brainwave Optimization find that they get “unstuck” and their ideas begin to flow. When we train out brains, we simple discharge static. The static is the fear that holds us back, the tension that keeps us from relaxing and allowing brain energy to flow freely, the mental fog that causes lack of clarity, the self-doubt that robs us of confidence, and the double-mindedness that splits our focus. As the static drops away, we become clear, intentional and inspired.</p>

										 <h3>Enhancing Sports Performance</h3>
										 <p>The brain drives the body. A balanced brain is a requirement for optimal performance. Since the brain controls the autonomic nervous system, it regulates heart rate and adrenaline, among many other bodily functions important to good health. Athletes find that when their brain is balanced, they can improve their reaction time, their balance, dexterity, focus, visual acuity, speed, strength and confidence. Training the brain is the new frontier in sports performance, and athletes everywhere – both amateur and professional – are experiencing results. To date, we’ve trained NASCAR drivers, swimmers, soccer players, football players, rugby players, bodybuilders, weightlifters, MMA fighters, and baseball players.</p>

										 <h3>Slowing the Aging Process</h3>
										 <p>Is it possible to slow the aging process through brain training? Our observation from seeing thousands of people train their brain is that when someone’s brain begins to process in a balanced way, they tend not to appear as old as their years say they are. Stress dissolves. Their eyes turn up a bit, their skin is somewhat renewed, wrinkles diminish to create a wise, sophisticated look, and sexual functioning is renewed. </div>

<p>Brainwave Optimization® is a computer-guided way to help you to achieve a uniquely deep state of relaxation, through the power of your own brain.  It acts as a catalyst to support the brain to optimize itself – to move itself naturally in its own way, its own time and on its own terms.
</p>
<p>Brainwave Optimization harnesses the power of advanced computing technology to create a high-definition Acoustic Brain Mirror™.  Biometric sensors are placed on your scalp, non-invasively, to read your brain rhythms with great precision. Software translates this brainwave activity into sounds of different pitch and timing. These sounds are played back to you through earbud headphones, in real time. This real-time reflection of brainwave activity which generates a pattern of music-like tones, supports and accelerates the brain’s ability to achieve deep states of relaxation where it can fully let go and reset itself. 
</p>
<p>If one cuts their finger, the healing process is driven by their own natural processes and resources. The capacity for this recovery is a basic property of all living things. Brainwave Optimization supports the brain’s own innate and natural ability to use its own resources to recover. The brain is like a musical instrument that has been knocked “out of tune” by life's challenges. Brainwave Optimization helps the brain to “re-tune itself” like an instrument in the middle of an orchestral performance.
</p>
<p>
Stress and trauma compromise and undermine our overall well-being. Stress and trauma, physical and/or emotional, can cause the brain to get “stuck”. The brain is the master regulator and therefore is the key to mediate the effects of this stress on one’s body, its systems and overall well-being. Brainwave Optimization® helps the brain, help itself, to get “unstuck” and return to a state of optimal functioning.
</p>

</div>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										
<P>	The basic differentiation of these modalities is based on the following:</p>
<h3>Biofeedback</h3>
<P>
Biofeedback is a type of learning used to lessen negative reactions for the individual, based on increasing the awareness of the biological process in order to off-set or stop the pathology as it begins to happen biologically and is applicable during the occurrence of the pathology. For example; panic attacks have biological indicators before the attacks hit, if you can learn the biological indicators you can lessen the panic attack by either degree and/or duration. Biofeedback is oriented to solve diagnosed problems in the client.
</p>
<h3>Neurofeedback</h3>
<P>
Neurofeedback is a type of learning used to lessen negative reactions for the individual, based on increasing the awareness of the neurological process in order to off-set or stop the pathology as it begins to happen neurologically. For example; training sensory-motor neurological frequencies to be more dominant for some athletic events. Neurofeedback is oriented to solve problems defined by a normative data base or model along with those problems and symptoms diagnosed by practitioner and client. Neurofeedback will usually be provided to clients in a medical model and will require 30 to multiple hundreds of sessions to achieve desired results.
</p>
<h3>Brainwave Optimization™</h3>
<P>
Brainwave Optimization™ is a type of brain optimization based on brain observance. It is based on a Quantum Physics understanding vs. a Newtonian Physics understanding of the individual, and this philosophical difference cannot be too heavily stressed as it makes everything intended different. Brainwave Optimization™seeks to show the brain itself – be a mirror for the brain in its ever more optimized state. The client is not trained with learned behavior. In fact a client may sleep through a session and still realize results because the brain can view itself without direct client participation. Although it is always more effective to have the client participate, it is not mandatory.
</p>
</div>

 <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="expact">
 <p>Our goal is to help our clients have a relaxing and transformative experience. Clients can expect to have expert attention, with explanations at every step of the process and satisfying results.
</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>
The assessment is the first step in the brain optimization process.  A brain assessment allows us to see individual patterns of energy within your brain.
Using non-invasive Intellisensors™, we will collect data from seven areas of the brain.  We will review information gathered from your assessment and discuss with you the results of your assessment, your goals, and how we will work together to achieve those goals.
</p>
<h3>Sessions</h3>
<p>
Each 100 minute brain training session will consist of implementing seven to nine protocols that are designed specifically for you, to help balance your brain. The brain technologist will place the Intellisensors at various places on your head, and you will be given ear phones. During each protocol, you will listen to your own brainwaves converted into musical notes, as well as other sounds meant to encourage the brain towards a more balanced state.  Clients often fall asleep during sessions and this is completely acceptable since the brain still receives all the information even in a sleep state.
</p>
<h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p>
Sessions are conducted in a comfortable private room with dim lighting.  The client relaxes in a very comfortable anti-gravity chair.  Some of the protocols are run while you sit upright and keep your eyes open. The majority of the session we will ask that you recline your chair and close your eyes. During all sessions, we will encourage you to remain as relaxed as possible.  In this relaxed state, your brain can receive and process information more easily.
</p>
<p>
Generally, people have more profound changes in between their sessions, as the brain works with the new information it has been given. So it is important to keep us informed about your daily experiences, including how you are sleeping.  Your daily report provides the information we need to understand how you are responding. The information you provide helps us fine-tune and adjust the protocols throughout your brain training sessions.
</p>
<p>
Many of our clients find it helpful to take notes or keep a journal beginning with your first day of sessions and continuing for one month after completion.  These journal entries can provide you with an ongoing record of your thoughts, emotions and awareness’s – helping you track your own progress.
</p>
<p>
Many people notice the most significant changes two to three weeks after completing their Brainwave Optimization sessions.  Results are generally subtle at first, and then they build over time.

			<h3>I've tried all kinds of medications and therapies (talk therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, EMDR, prolonged exposure therapy)</h3>
<p>Many who find their way to Brainwave OptimizationT do so after years of searching and frustration in working to overcome life challenges. The simple answer is our revolutionary system works. Regardless of the life trauma or behavioral difficulties you have endured, they have created an imprint on the brain. When we see the imprint, we are able to identify the problem and address it.</p>

<h3>Can I achieve the same results at home with one of the brain modification products currently available commercially?</h3>
<p>While there are numerous gimmicks and various brainwave modification paraphernalia available to the home-user, take-home binaural beat technology (products like Hemi-sync and Holo-sync, to name a few) are by far the most popular. These are mass-marketed CDs; products that force the brain into pre-programmed frequencies, pre-set by the device manufacturer. These types of products are considered brain "entrainment" devices and results vary from good, to neutral, to negative.</p>

<p>This is not the same technology as Brainwave Optimization. The critical difference is that entrainment products are a one-size-fits-all approach. Brainwave Optimization, on the other hand, is individually tailored to suite your specific brain. With Brainwave Optimization, your progress will be monitored and the methodologies adjusted so that you can achieve your own personal goals within a safe environment.</p>

<h3>But I've had neurofeedback and/or biofeedback. Isn't this the same thing?</h3>
<p>Although there are similarities in that each of these modalities deals with creating healthier brain patterns, there are significant differences. </p>

<p>Brainwave Optimization is a specialized and proprietary process that has been found to have measurable and relatively quick results in mitigating issues related to an imbalanced brain. Because we provide individualized training, and because Brainwave Optimization is done "in real time," there are no off-the-shelf approaches. Your experience is uniquely geared to you and your needs.</p>

<h3>Does it work?</h3>
<p>More than 90 percent of our clients report that Brainwave Optimization has resulted in an improved quality of life. More than 80 percent report significant improvements in their lives. Hear about results from our clients for just a few of the unedited testimonials offered by those who have experienced Brainwave Optimization.</p>

<p>With each person we have one mission: to balance and harmonize their brain. As the brain comes into balance, other issues are addressed - clients report that they feel better, sleep better, have increased clarity, enhanced intellectual and physical performance and a greater sense of happiness and hope.</p>

<p>Each brain is like a fingerprint, with each person responding in their own way.  Due to this fact, we cannot guarantee how a person will respond or what exactly will change for them.</p>

<h3>How does Brainwave Optimization work?</h3>
<p>Brainwave Optimization with RTBT (Real Time Balancing) is a holistic, non-invasive method during which impaired brain wave activity is identified and then restored to its optimal ability. Throughout the process, you will have the opportunity to see your brain in action, and experience your own brainwaves transformed into sounds that melodically guide your brain back to balance. </p>

<p>Brain State Technologies® founder, Lee Gerdes, discovered that when the brain reaches a state of homeostasis, physical and emotional issues tend to fade or disappear. To learn more about Lee and his discovery of the power of brain balancing, you may want to read his book or listen to him discuss his work.</p>

<h3>Who can brainwave optimization help?</h3>

<h3>Does Brainwave Optimization work for individuals of any age?</p>
<p>We have found Brainwave Optimization to be effective for people of nearly any age, ranging from five to 100.  The sessions are pleasant and relaxing and require only the ability to remain relatively still for about an hour, so that sensors placed on the head remain secure.</p>

<h3>What types of issues can be relieved with Brainwave Optimization?</p>
<p>Brainwave Optimization works for a wide array of individuals and issues. Some people come to us to maximize their potential - seeking clearer thinking, enhanced creativity, improved athletic/physical performance or just an overall increased sense of happiness and well-being.</p>

<p>Brainwave Optimization has also shown positive results with those who are challenged by learning disorders, sleep disturbances, headaches and pain. Some of the most satisfying results have been experienced by those battling some of the most life-debilitating issues like panic attacks and anxiety disorders, sadness, drug, alcohol, gambling and sex addictions, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

<p>Regardless of the presenting condition, we are constantly gratified by the results our clients report. Given the nature of the technology, we cannot predict or guarantee results; nor do we diagnose, heal, treat, cure, or address specific symptoms. We see it very simply; we help the brain achieve a natural state of balance and harmony which leads to relaxation and self-regulation.</p>

<h3>What's the process?</p>

<h3>What is the average time commitment?</p>
<p>Most clients initially commit to a series of 10, 90-minute sessions - what we call "an intensive." This is the time period that we have found delivers the best results for most people. (Individuals with severe, life-debilitating or life-long issues may find that more time is required.)  We find that it is important for these sessions to occur within a one- to two-week period of time, during which the client minimizes other life activities. Occasionally, a client will need to take vacation time from work or school.</p>

<h3>Will my insurance cover the costs?</p>
<p>Some people have health care accounts that may help with the cost, or they may have an insurance that allows alternative modalities to be explored. This is something that you must check with your own insurance company and your local Brainwave Optimization provider.</p>

<h3>Do people experience any negative side effects from Brainwave Optimization?</p>
<p>We have not seen negative effects from Brainwave Optimization.  People who experience Brainwave Optimization - and those around them -- notice changes. Typically, those changes are toward more effectiveness, not less. Clients report that things like focus, memory, concentration and a sense of happiness and well-being increase. Our tools are used to help your brain restore itself to its natural and desired state of balance.</p>

<h3>Why can't I drink while I am doing the Brainwave Optimization?</p>
<p>Alcohol (or illegal drugs) taken during Brainwave Optimization and within the three weeks following the completion of sessions act as a "wet blanket" on the brain. Instead of new, healthier connections being made rapidly and with ease, alcohol slows the response time. Our goal is to help you arrive at maximum effectiveness as quickly and easily as possible. That is why we work with you to minimize any activity that will hamper that progress and ask that you not ingest toxic substances during or, for a limited time, after the sessions.</p>

<h3>What happens during the actual Brainwave Optimization session?</p>
<p>In its simplest form, a Brainwave Optimization session feels very much like an induced state of relaxation or mediation. You will be seated in a quiet, comfortable room in an anti-gravity chair, with a brain technologist by your side. Although there are protocols during which you will be asked to remain awake, often clients are so comfortable that they may cuddle up in a blanket and fall into a pleasant and deep sleep.</p>

<p>Some of the training will be with active (eyes open and you may watch a video or other activity on the computer screen), and some will be passive (with your eyes closed), during which time the brain technologist may allow you to sleep or will direct you in a personal visualization or imaging exercise.</p>

<p>Most people report a highly pleasurable experience and enjoy hearing their own brainwaves transformed into relaxing sound.</p>

<h3>How safe is my information? Who sees my results?</p>
<p>Your results are private between you and your brain technologist. All data that is transferred to the main Brain State database is encrypted for client privacy, and goes beyond federal privacy rules. The research team at Brain State never sees the client name or any identifiable client information so you are never directly associated with any data we may receive.</p>

<h3>Should I stop taking my medication while doing sessions?</p>
<p>Many medications - both over-the-counter and prescription - can have an effect on mood, concentration, sleep, pain, and/or energy levels.  Brainwave Optimization may facilitate improvements in these areas by helping the brain to better regulate itself.</p>

<p>If you are using any type of medication, please be aware that it may influence the outcome of your training. If you are taking any medication on an "as-needed" basis, you may wish to consider taking less of it during your training.</p>

<p>Brain State Technologies® does not make any specific recommendations about medication usage. Please direct any questions about medication usage to your health care provider.</p>

<p>We recommend that you share your Brainwave Optimization experience with your physician, therapist, chiropractor, massage therapist, medical spa, and/or any other alternative, medical, or therapeutic provider you may have.  Please click here for a letter you can provide to your health care professional to help them understand Brainwave Optimization.</p>

<h3>Once I decide to receive Brainwave Optimization, what are the first steps?</p>
<p>As a new client, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire prior to your first visit that helps us gain a full understanding of your issues, concerns and training goals. Your brain technologist will discuss the questionnaire with you in order to gain a mutual understanding of what you need and the results you are seeking. Unlike more traditional therapies, it is not necessary that you discuss your past or current life challenges.  </p>

<p>Once you and your brain technologist have a clear understanding of your situation and goals, he or she will conduct a brain assessment - a one-hour session during which sensors are non-invasively placed on various sections of your head. The result of this session is a brain assessment - a visual guide that illustrates areas of brain wave disturbance (also called "brain imbalances"). The brain assessment will be used to create a personalized training program for you.</p>
